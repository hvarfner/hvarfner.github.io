**About me**

I am a fourth-year PhD student in Machine Learning, specifically Bayesian Optimization, at Lund University in Sweden. In May 2024, I will be joining Meta as a Research Scientist Intern, working on Adaptive Experimentation and Bayesian Optimization.
 
My [Github](https://github.com/hvarfner/) containing various research- and non-research-related projects


**Research**


* **May, 2024:** My work [Vanilla Bayesian Optimization Performs Great in High Dimensions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02229) was accepted to ICML 2024!
* **January, 2024:** My work [A General Framework for User-Guided Bayesian Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14645) was accepted to ICLR 2024 as a Spotlight presentation (top 5%)!
* **September, 2023:** My work [Self-Correcting Bayesian Optimization through Bayesian Active Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11005) was accepted to NeurIPS 2023!


**Outreach**


* [AutoML Seminar talk:] I am scheduled to present at the [AutoML Seminar series](https://automl-seminars.github.io/) on June 13, 2024.

* [Talk at Unversity of Copenhagen:] I recently presented my work on high-dimensional Bayesian Optiization at the Pioneer Center for AI in Copenhagen on May 3, 2024.

* [SecondMind talk:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-huaWITLyE8&t=16s) A large portion of my work was presented by my supervisor, Luigi Nardi, at [SecondMind](https://www.secondmind.ai)
