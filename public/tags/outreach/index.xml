      <description>The version 2.0 of LAMMPS tutorial has just been published, and offers: * a new structure with a sphinx template * tutorials are now written in rst format, instead of html, which should facilitate future collaborations * a gorgeous dark mode (for the tutorials, not yet for the index page)
The version 1.0 is still visible here, but is not maintained and some commands are likely to be obsolete.</description>
