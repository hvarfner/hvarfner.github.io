      <description>Scope. With the goal to reach carbon neutrality by 2050, direct air capture (DAC) of CO2 from wet flue gases is one brick of the carbon mitigation strategy â€“ especially with the next generation of solid porous sorbents based on Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOF). While thermodynamics of the CO2 capture is well documented in the literature, little is known about molecular diffusion and transport properties in MOF angstropores (in particular, in the presence of environmental humidity).</description>

      <description>The version 2.0 of LAMMPS tutorial has just been published, and offers: * a new structure with a sphinx template * tutorials are now written in rst format, instead of html, which should facilitate future collaborations * a gorgeous dark mode (for the tutorials, not yet for the index page)
The version 1.0 is still visible here, but is not maintained and some commands are likely to be obsolete.</description>
